# phys_lab_physics

This was my Lab Physics class. The class was very different; we completed extremely interesting experiments such as measuring the speed of light, measuring the speed of sound in different mediums, and even measuring the gravitational constant! (and much more). I included a walkthrough of the data analysis done for each lab in each lab directory. To run these files put the folder in your google drive, open the analysis.ipynb file in google colab, and change the path of the data directory so that it matches that in your google drive. Check it out if you enjoy Physics!

The labs are as follows:
------------------------
C Lab- Measuring the Speed of Light \n
G Lab- Measuring the Gravitational Constant
CAP Lab- Measuring the Capacitance of Different Materials
HD Lab- Measuring the Mass of a Neutron
LZ Lab- Measuring many Aspects of a Helium-Neon Laser
SND Lab- Measuring the Speed of Sound in different Mediums
